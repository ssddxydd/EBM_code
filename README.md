# EBM_code
WIP

East Belfast Mission (EBM) room booking system with full albeit amateur-ish documentation created in 2015. Full intructions on usage and purpose may be found withing the folder titled "Manual".
The aim of this project was finding a business or charity which could use digital solution to a problem they have been experiencing. Written in Visual Basic and using OOP throughout, the project is functional but flawed.
Issues and potential solutions can be found in the "Evaluation" folder/file.
